16, case, and aen-sd as agreeing with it. But the only authority he cites sor
virgulta in this form is Lutatius or Lactantius, a grammarian os the fourth
century. and to him Drakenborch will allow no weight against tlie usage ot
Livy, who uniformly in other places has this noun in the neuter, the only
form, it is said, in which it is used by the earlier and purer writers. Baile ,
however, in his supplement to the Lexicon os Forcellinus, cites Columella
as using virgultas in the accusative. Columella's authority could not be set
aside on the same grounds 3 but the s is not found in all good editions.

27. In duodecim menses deseri-bit annum] The solar year, as measured
by the revolution os the earth round the sun, or by the apparent revolution
osthe sun about the earth (i. e. annus qui solstitialz circumgitur orbe), con-
sists of 36 days (neglecting odd minutes and seconds, which the calendar
of Numa a so disregarded.) The lumtr year is 354 days, being made *up
of 12 revolutions of the moon about the earth (or 12 months), each consist-
ing οἵ 2925 days (quia tricenos dies singulis mensibus luna mm explet.)
There is, then, a difference of 11} days between a solar and a lunar year.
Supposfflg, therefore, the sun and moon to set out srorn the same point m
the heavens, when the sun had returned to that point (or meta), the moon,
having finished 12 complete revolutions, would now be erforming the 13311,
and would require 1Ῑᾶ days to arrive at the point srom w ich she set out with
the sun. Thus the [απαν- year would be constantly falling behind the solar,
and the names os the months, or portioris os the lunar year, would cease to
be associated with the several seasonS, as these depend on the sun, i. e. the
solar year. To keep, therefore, the lunar years adjusted to the solar, so that
nearly the same months shall always be in the same seasons, it is necessary
from time to time to intere-alate or insert (imercalare, interponere) a certain
number os da s in the calendar os the lunar yearS. This Livy informs us
that Numa did', (intercalaribus mensibus incer-ponendis) in such a way. that at
the end os24 years he had inserted days enough to amount to the difference
between that number os solar and os lunar years (plenis annorum omnium
spatiis), so that the sun and moon were again together at that point os the
neaveus or of the sun's path at which this series ol* years began, and solar
time again agreed with lunar at this point (ut dies congruerent ad metam
eamdem solis, unde orsi essent). This interval between one agreement os
