Ξ. Salis, etc.] This difficult sentence. as it here stands, seems to admit of 65,
but one meaning3 and iu order to that, translato, recepto, redacto, or some

whole expense [of making it, os managing the salt-works] being transferred
to the public treasury,’ i. e. the manufacturing and selling of it being assumed
by the overnment, that it might be atl'orded to the people at a cheaper rate,

lon er formed a part os the price.

sumptum is proposed as an emen ation, which is said to be not without the
authority os some manuscripts, The meaning would thus be, ‘ The privilege
os vending salt, because tt was sold at an exorbitant price [by the con·
tractors]‚ was wholly assumed b r the overnment‚ as a matter os public
administration, and taken out oft e banis os private persons.'
