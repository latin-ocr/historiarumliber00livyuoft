NOTES. 231

solar with lunar time, and another, is called a cycle. Numa is said to have 20
made up his cycle of 24 years thus: dividing it into three periods of 8 solar ¹
years, he gained in each period 8><nss=90 days, which distributing into 4
intercalary months (viz. two os 22 days each, and two os 23 days each) he
inserted one of these (a short and a long one alternately) every second year
aster the 2311 day os February. But as he made the lunar year to consist

os 355 days (instead of 354) in order to have an odd number, which was
considered as a fortunate number, he was thus intercalating 24 days. In the
third period osB ears, therefore, he had, instead os 90, only 66 days to insert,
which he did in t ree intercalary months os 222 days each. Though Numa’s
cycle was afterwards disused, yet tlte principle of cycles and intercalation is

the same in all subsequent reson-ms osthe calendar.
