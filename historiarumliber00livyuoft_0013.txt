PREFACE. vn

the book will be found to possess a good degree of unity‚
few events being mentioned as if within the reader's knowl-
edge, of which an account has not been given in some pre-
ceding extract.

The text of Drakenborch has been adopted, aS, on the
whole, of the highest authority 3 but, Livy being the author
first read in our Colleges, care has been taken to conform the
orthography of those words which may be variously written,
to the Dictionaries and Grammars in common use. With a
similar regard to the condition of newly formed classes,
necessarily consisting of individuals of different degrees of
proficiency, certain ambiguous words are distinguished by
accents; but students should become accustomed to dispense
with these facilities in some part of their course, for modern
editions of the classics rarely afford them*

The notes, which are chiefly derived from the editions os
Miiller, Doering, and Ruperti, fill as much space as could well
be allowed to them in this edition, since it was thought best
not to exceed the size of the volume for which this is pro-
posed as a substitute. In quantity, however, that volume is
considerably exceeded by the present. The notes are devoted
principally to the First Book, because more real difficulties
occur here, and because the student must be supposed to
need fewer eyplanations as he advances, from having become

'‘ In employing accentual marks, Ruddiman's rules are followed. ·’·’ In-
declinable words of the same form with words declinable, and preposi-
tions used without a case, as adverbs, have a grave aceent on the last
syllable. ;'' and, agreeably to Ruddiman also, this accerrt is not changed
to an acute when an enclitic follows, since the purpose for which ”the
mark is here used has no connexion with the sound. When, however,
the declinable word is such as is found very rarely, and the indeelinable
word of the same spelling is of very frequent occurrence, the necent is
omitted, e. g. satis, magis, soepe. “ Contraeted syllables are marked with
a circumflex3 also the final syllable of the ablative of the first decien-
si0n‚‘’ and this (contrary to Ruddiman) even when the governing prepo-
sition is expressed.
