Norsss. 279

31. Patres] “ Patres dicebantur, quoniam a plebe tanquam patres vene· 11

hac ap ellatione patrocinium et patrocinari descendunt.’'

30. iocati hospitii foedus] violati sor violatum. See note, p. 5. 1. 13 12.

denominatim sor sect, when we speak os the Lutlteran denominatim, etc.

34. Per occasionem ac solitudinem] i. e. per occasionem solitudinis, oppor-
tune per solitudinem.

29.. Inter vos Similar changes from the third person to the first and second
(from oblique to direct discourse, as it is called.) and the contrary, are not
uncommon in the best ancient writers. In En -lish it is necessary to give
notice os the change by said they, or some such p irase.

14. Occupant bellum facere] Occupant refers to priusquam. ‘ Are before· 16,

hand vtl¹ith them in making war! Occupare, ‘ to anticipate,' is again used,
p 22. Locis circa densa obsita virgulta obscuris] Scarcely any passage in
Livy has more puzzled commentators than this. Some regard it as corrupt,
tlssough ancient copies, both manuscript and printed, agree in the reading
a ove iven.

Of t ose who consider the text as sound, some think densa is used ad-
verbially sor dens& (as in Virwil, Georgics, ii. 275. Dens& sere), and qualifies
obsita : some make densa an obsita both agree with virgulta, and interpret
obsita by adsita, ad’acentia: and some write ob sita as two words, either
placing¹ a comma a ter circei, thus locis circu, densa ob sita virgulta obscuris,
or, wit ont a comma, construing as if, ob circu densa sita virg-ulta. To those
os the above modes in which obsita is written as one word, it is objected,
that, in its usual sense of‘ set thick witli,’ ¹ overgrown or covered with,5 it
always agrees with the thing covered, and not with that which covers 3 thus
loca obsita virgultis is a pro er expression, but not so virgulta obsita locis :
while the inter retation οἵ o sita by adjacentia is not warrantcd by a single
example. It as also been objected that the construction, which occurs in
the above modes, os two adjectives before one substantive, is harsh and,
unusual 5 but examples sufficient to justisy this are found in Livy, as well as
other authors, e. g. curulis regia sella, speciosus ultimus dies, etc.

Those who think the text corru t are no less at variance with each other
as to tbe manner os restoring it. ne reading proposed is locis circ& denso
obsito virg-ulto obscuris, another, dense obsito virgulto, (both os which are open
to the objection mentioned above, of applying obsito to the wrong ol)ject);
another, partem militum locis circii denso ohsitis ving-ulto obscuram. A fourth
reforms the passage by leaving out obsita, as a gloss (or explanatory word)
in tlte margin of the manuscript, which by accident came into the text3 while
a fisth, and the happiest emendation of all, is by Heinsius, locis circ& denso
obsitis virgulto ac obscuris.

This note, which is chiefly a mere abstract os the accumulated annotations
on the passage tn Drakenborch’s edition os Livy (omitting alon array os
citations and the names of a multitude of critics), is here placed lictore the
young student as a specimen of the sort os apparatus which accompanies a
co ious variorum edition osan ancient classic.

rakenborch mentions the o inion of a learned friend os liis, that the
common reading may be desen ed, and the whole difficulty done away, by
considering virgulta as a feminine noun os the first declension in the ablativo
