PREFACE.

 

Tffls selection from the History of Livy is published with
particular reference to those Colleges and higher schools,
in which the first Five Books have hitherto formed a part
of the course of Latin studies. The editor, by his expe-
rience as an instructer in Harvard University, was led
to obser-ve that the volume in common use, though it con-
tains some of the finest passages of this writer, is yet in
great part uninteresting to young students. To such, many
of the details, which are necessary to the completeness of
the Roman annals‚ prove wearisome from their similarity‚
if not from their want of importance. And to say nothing
of the injustice done to the author by taking arbitrarily
the first five books of a History of infinite variety, and con-
sisting, as he wrote it, of at least one hundred and forty
books (from thirty-five of which we still have a choice),
justice is thus hardly rendered to those who may never have
an opportunity to read more of the work than is compre-
hended in their early studies, or whose reading of the whole
may depend on the impression given by this part.

Until he had principally made this selectim, the editor
was unable to learn that any book, having the same object,
had been published3 nor is he yet aware that any such is
in use in Great Britain or in the South of Europe3 but the
kindness of friends has furnished him with two, published
in Germany in the course of the last century* Os these,
