the earlier one does not extend beyond the first twelve
books, is without notes, and otherwise is sar from being
prepared with so good judgment as the other, which is
accompanied by notes, generally in Latin, but sometimes
in German. All the extracts in the later one are to be
found also in the present volume, besides others which the
purpose of the selection seemed equally to require. The
propriety of giving the First Book entire will be obvious to
all who consider how often the subject of it is alluded to,
both in ancient and modern literature3 while, with regard
to the remainder of the volume, the world has been too long
agreed as to what are masterpieceS‚ to leave any doubt about
the absolute excellence of the particular passages chosen‚ or
much hesitation in preferring them to many others inferior
only to these. The editor has endeavoured to save the
volume from the appearance of unconnected fragments by
giving entire the Epitomae* of all the books from the first to
the last os those embraced in it, the portioris which cor-
respond to the text being distinguished by a larger type.

'‘ These Epitomoe by some, with little reason however, have beon at-
tributed to Livy himself3 but, whoevor was their author, they bear a
classical stamp. and are models of the kind of composition to which they
belong. Laboring under the odium of having been. as the substitute
for the full History, the probable occasion os the negligence with which
that was kept, and thus of the loss of the greater part of it, this obstruet
is sometimes spoken of contemptuously3 but Gravina (De Instauratioue
Studiorum) does not hesitate to recoinmend the study of the Epitvme
Liviana to young persons, ‘· ut qum longe= simplicior et candidior sn
Flori et Vellcji libris, resque exprimat propriis et convenientibus verbis,
