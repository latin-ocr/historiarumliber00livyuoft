ine. ΡΛ
1, l. Operoe pretium] i. e. opus utile, ί a thing worth the while.’ This Pref- 33⁹⁸
ace happens to beerin with the first four feet of a hexameter verse, and is
cited by Quintilian t(lib. ix. c. 4.) as a faulty use of poetic numbers in a prose
com osition.

4.pRem] referred by some to res populi Romani ; ‘ aware that the mat-
ter is remote in time, and has osten been treated! Others refer rem to
perscribere res populi Romam· ,· ⁴ a thing that has long since and often been
done! Others, again, refer rem to Fucturusne operoe pretium, etc. ,· ‘ as Ι
observe it is an old and common custom among writers dicere se operae pretium
facturae, eaclh new writer believing he shall surpass his predecessors either in
matter or st e.

8. Pro vz²yrili parte] by some understood as pro viribus, ‘ to the utmost of
my ability'3 but virilis pars οι· portio was a law phrase, signifying that por-
tion osan inheritance distributed viritim, which fell to each os the heim, and
hence was used for ‘share,' ¹ participationss in general. ‘ That I also have
done my share ’ or ‘ borne my part in recordin the exploits,⁷ etc.

9. Smiptornm tur-bd] Many of whom are a erwards named by Livy3 but
hardly any thin remains os them except a part of Polybius (in Greek.)

13. Magnitu ine laboret] In the same sense⁷ Livy (lib. vii. c. 29.) has
mannitudo quae vix sustinetur, speakin os the Roman empire. So Horace
(odes, 1. ix. 3.) describes the woods {aden with snow as laborantes: and
Ovid (Met. ii. 296.) applies the same word to Atlas supporting the heavens.

22. Ante condicam condendamve] ¹ before the city was begun to be built,
or the design os building it was sormed’ by Romulus. Condendam here
refers to the time of the transactions that gave occasion to the building os it,
as, page 51, line 32, principia condendi hujus operis refers to what preceded
the building of the temple there spoken of, after it was designcd to be built,
and before it was actually begun.

3. Ett]¹ This conjuncuon, as well as que, is osten used by Livy to connect 4.
two wor s or clauses, of which the latter is merely explanatorv of the former,

and means the same thing. Thus ad Deos referre auctores h'ere shows what
is meant by consecrare origines.

3. Ea] ¹ that, such, so great!

8. Mihi] is not without soree here, intimating the author’s own opinion,
and connecting this sentence with the preceding. ‘ These and similar mat-
ters 1 shall not much insist on 3 bu't 1 would particularly direct the attention
of every one,’ etc. Mihi, tibi, etc. are seldom or never mere expletives‚ but
serve at least to ive liveliness to the discourse.

12. Desidemega ‘ sinking! This figure, taken from a building, the
foundations os w ich are gradually 'ving way is followed out in mag-is
magisque lapsi sint, ‘incline more anclpmoress and ire praecipites, ‘ sall head-

long!
